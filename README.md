# PredictionIran-sPriceHouses

By posting different ads for real estate and land, the dataset is formed little by little

First, according to the entered neighborhood, we get the date and price of the desired location from the database

Then we fill in its null values and normalize the data.
look_back, which is the number of previous time steps to use as input variables for predicting the next time period â€“ in this case, the default is 1.

This assumption creates a data set where X is the number of prices at a given time (t) and Y is the number of prices at the next time (t + 1).

The network has a visible layer with 1 input, a hidden layer with 50 LSTM blocks or neurons, and an output layer that predicts a single value.
Default sigmoid activation function is used for LSTM blocks. The network is trained for 50 epochs and a batch size of 32 is used.
We reverse the predictions to ensure that the price returns in the same units as the original data in the API output.
